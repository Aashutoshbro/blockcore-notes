      <p>Hi, welcome to Blockcore Notes.</p>

      <p>To get started using notes and accessing the incredible world of Nostr, you must first connect your browser extension with this website.</p>

      <p>Browser extension keeps your account safe and secret from everyone, including us.</p>

      <p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockcore-wallet/peigonhbenoefaeplkpalmafieegnapj" target="_blank">Blockcore Wallet</a> (Chrome Web Store)</p>

      <p>
        Whenever we need you to perform a signing of a note, we'll notify your extension of choice to perform the signing. We suggest not approving a permanent permission, but instead accept each individual confirmation. This ensures you
        never sign anything you did not intend.
      </p>
